The grime, overcrowding, noise &amp; smoke of the city is more than compensated for by the amazing public transport and world class cultural events (again, for &lt;£15 -- Newcastle has great cultural venues but even if they are of the same standard I could not afford to go regularly as it was more than twice as expensive)<p>I would never have discovered my love for Classical music, Ballet or Opera if the opportunities weren&#x27;t so numerous and the tickets so cheap.
